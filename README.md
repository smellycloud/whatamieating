#### Try to build a decent model based on the Food101 dataset and beat the accuracies of 77.4% [1] and 56.40% [2]. ðŸ¤·

* Uses Tensorflow and EfficientNetV2_B0
* Trained on the entire dataset with 101 classes
* Try to follow ML best practices (lol)

## Results

| Model    |      Accuracy |
|----------|:-------------:|
| efnb0_1  |     72.44%    |
| efnb0_2  |     81.30%    |
