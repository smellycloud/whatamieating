#### Try to outperform the state-of-the-art (possibly?) model's accuracy on the Food101 dataset of 77.4% [1] and 56.40% [2].

* Uses Tensorflow and EfficientNetV2_B0
* Trained on the entire dataset with 101 classes
* Try to follow deep learning best practices (lol)

## Results

| Model    |      Accuracy |
|----------|:-------------:|
| efnb0_1  |     72.44%    |
| efnb0_2  |     81.30%    |
